# Dockerized-Microservices-Application

🎯 Purpose of This Project

To simulate how real SaaS products are built and deployed in production using containerized microservices.

This project teaches you:

How companies break applications into multiple independent services

How Docker is used to package, deploy, scale, and manage them

How real production systems handle networking, secrets, persistence, health checks, and failures

In short:

This project shows that you understand real-world DevOps & Docker architecture, not just basic commands.
